Hacker Marathon is a simple yet challenging runner game. In this game, you play as one character, David, who is trying to stop hackers from invading CS50's personal information. In order to do this, he avoids binary numbers, as well as the number 5, while trying to stall the hackers as long as he possibly can. Several options lie ahead for David as he tries to protect the information of his students. Will he stop the hackers?


{OBJECTIVE}


Your goal is to get the highest score you possibly can before all of your lives are gone.


{CONTROLS}


To move across the orange platform, use the arrow keys. To jump, press the spacebar.


{OBSTACLES}


Numbers will be flying from both sides of the platform. Each one of them will take away one life - unless you have an item with you. 


{ITEMS}


Gems, while ever tricky to get, provide an increase in your score. If you are able to stay still when you get a gem, you will gain 100 points while seeing your character transform. 

Every 4 gems you get gives you a one-point increase in your multiplier. This will cause your score to increase twice as fast!

If you get hit by an obstacle with a gem, you return back to David. If you get hit as David, you will lose one life. 

Here are the characters David will transform into if you pick up these gems:

Red - Colton from the Game Development Track

Yellow - Emma as the Head Course Assistant

Green - Tyler from the App Development Track

Blue - Brian as the Preceptor


{MISCELLANIOUS INFORMATION}

DO NOT GO OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM. This will result in you losing a life.

You can restart the game by hitting the "r" key after you lose all of your lives.

Hit the "esc" key to exit the game.

You can resize the game's screen, if you wish. 

Try to hit several keys at the end of the game to see all of the characters.

Try to get to 3000 points, as this is when David has successfully stalled the hackers long enough for the personal information to be safe.


THAT'S IT! Enjoy playing this simple yet fun runner game!
